# PackCAD

PackCAD is a parametric 3D modeling tool for designing folded geometry, based on the design principles of origami.  We are initially targeting design workflows in the packaging industry, but hope that this tool will be broadly useful in other areas of manufacturing and design.

PackCAD is currently in a private beta, feel free to sign up at [packcad.com](https://packcad.com).

We will be using this repository to track issues and development of the PackCAD project.  Please feel free to open [Issues](https://github.com/amandaghassaei/packcad-beta/issues) for bugs.  You can also request new features, ask questions, or share things you're working on in [Discussions](https://github.com/amandaghassaei/packcad-beta/discussions).

All info posted to this GitHub repository is publicly available, if you have sensitive information or files that you'd like to share with PackCAD developers, please email support@formfinding.studio instead.
